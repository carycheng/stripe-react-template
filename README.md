## Stripe React Template

The purpose of this application is to act as a quick boostrap to build an application on top of, showcasing the power of the Stripe API. This template integrates with Stripe Elements and allows the user to complete a simple checkout process with a card.

### Built With
This template is very lightweight but still makes use of a couple libraries. It currently uses React.js as the frontend and Node.js in the backend. We also integrated with Stripe Elements to handle all the heavy lifting with accepting sensitive payment information.

This template currently uses React class components.
